This repository contains some notebooks I used to generate a bunch of plots about the statistics of stuff on the Archive of Our Own fanfiction archive.

Please note: due to the nature of the analyzed works, some of this data may not be suitable for your workplace.

The underlying data, and the database interface I built (called ao3db), I have not made public, since it contains information now removed from the Internet by its creators (my data is a static copy of AO3 metadata at the time of collection). But the notebooks are here, with plots intact, for those who would like to see how the plots were made & the analysis done.
